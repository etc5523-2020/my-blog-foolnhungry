# Introduction
This blog is a self-reflection about the shiny-app assignment. The shiny app I built is about the COVID-19 situation in Australia and it includes 3 sections——the plot section, the table section, and the about section. Data is from a package called "coronavirus".

## Plot Section
I built two interactive plots: one is a bar graph to show for each state, the newest cumulative number of confirmed cases available in that package.the other is to show the trend of confirmed cases from 2020-01-22 to 2020-08-31 in each state. When click on the bar in the first plot, the second plot will react to show the corresponding state.

## Table Section
In this section, I built a table and intended to let user explore by choosing the type of the cases(death, confirmed, recovered).

## About
This section contains basic information about 

# Self Review

 What did I do well?  |   What are the points I can improve on?
----------------------|---------------------------------------
1. I applied shiny theme and used icons beside tab title to make the interface visual appealing. |      1.The content is not abundant enough. 
2. The data is directly from a package, makes the shiny app be reproduced easily. |      2.The data visualization can be improved.
3. The interface is well organized.                                                                                 |  3. The table can be more interactive.
## additional point:

### What are some things that you’d like to add that’s plausible? 
I would like to add a dynamic map that change over time to show the variation of the situation among these states.

### What are some things that you’d like to add that cannot be done yet due to limitation in data or technology?
I want to improve the table to have more interaction.
